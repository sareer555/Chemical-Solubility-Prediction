# Chemical-Solubility-Prediction
Build a machine learning model to predict the solubility of chemical compounds (logS) based on molecular properties like molecular weight, logP (lipophilicity), and structural descriptors.
2. Tools & Libraries
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, RDKit, Matplotlib/Seaborn

SQL: For querying additional compound data (optional)

Dataset: Delaney Solubility Dataset (1,143 compounds with measured solubility).
